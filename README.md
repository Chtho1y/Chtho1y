# About Me

Hi there! My name is Chtho1y. I’m an innovator, design hacker, programmer and game developer. I currently serve as the Partner and CEO of **WorldFlow Technology Limited**, and I'm also the founder of **NexusAI Infinite Unbounded Community** and the initiator of the **AGI Engage Organization**. Formerly a Computer Science student at Fudan University, I’m on a leave of absence to focus on entrepreneurship.

> I'm an effective accelerationist, a believer in the AGI arrival—and yes, Cursor is my go-to coding weapon.
